## Purpose

Let a project activate only the skills it needs through local links while preserving and safely transitioning any independent skills already owned by that project.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Explicit multi-target project activation
The system SHALL activate a selected library skill only for user-selected target agents, creating an absolute soft link in each target agent's recognized project skill location. It SHALL support an explicit option to select all detected supported target agents.

#### Scenario: Skill is activated for selected agents
- **WHEN** the user confirms activation of a library skill for Claude Code and Codex
- **THEN** the system creates one absolute soft link per selected target in that project's corresponding skill location

#### Scenario: Compatibility is not declared for a target
- **WHEN** the user selects a target agent not included in a skill's compatibility declaration
- **THEN** the system displays a compatibility warning and permits the explicitly confirmed activation

### Requirement: Project skill inventory
The system SHALL list project skills by target agent and distinguish managed skills, unmanaged directory skills, and orphaned links.

#### Scenario: Project contains both managed and unmanaged skills
- **WHEN** the user lists skills in a project containing a library link and an independent directory skill
- **THEN** the output labels the linked skill as managed and the independent directory as unmanaged

### Requirement: Safe managed-skill removal
The system SHALL remove only the selected project-side managed soft link and SHALL NOT delete its corresponding library skill. It SHALL refuse to remove an unmanaged project skill through the managed-skill removal command.

#### Scenario: Managed skill is removed from one project
- **WHEN** the user confirms removal of a managed skill from a project
- **THEN** the project soft link is removed and the library directory remains available

#### Scenario: Unmanaged skill is selected for removal
- **WHEN** the user requests managed-skill removal for an independent project directory
- **THEN** the system refuses the operation without changing that directory

### Requirement: Adoption of an existing project skill
The system SHALL allow an existing eligible project directory skill to be adopted into the library. Adoption SHALL place the skill content in the library and replace the former project directory with a managed soft link only after the user confirms the displayed plan.

#### Scenario: Existing skill is adopted
- **WHEN** the user confirms adoption of an eligible independent project skill whose library identifier is unused
- **THEN** the skill is added to the library and its former project location becomes a link to the added library skill

#### Scenario: Adoption has a conflicting library identifier
- **WHEN** the library already contains a skill with the proposed identifier
- **THEN** the system refuses to overwrite either skill until the user explicitly chooses a supported conflict strategy

### Requirement: Forking a managed project skill
The system SHALL allow a managed project skill to be forked into an independent project directory without modifying the library skill or other projects that link to it.

#### Scenario: Managed skill is forked
- **WHEN** the user confirms a fork of a managed project skill
- **THEN** the project link is replaced with an independent copy and the library skill remains unchanged
